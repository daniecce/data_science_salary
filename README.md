# Data Science Salary Analysis (2020-2023)

## Project Overview
This repository is dedicated to an SQL-based analysis of the Data Science job market covering the period from 2020 to 2023. It includes a series of SQL queries that were crafted to extract insights into job demands, salary distributions, experience levels, work models, and salary trends in the field of Data Science.

## SQL Queries
The SQL queries provided in this repository serve different analytical purposes:

1. `Top_10_Data_Science_Roles_by_Demand.sql` - Retrieves the top 10 Data Science roles by job demand.
2. `Top_10_Data_Science_Roles_by_Average_Salary.sql` - Fetches the top 10 Data Science roles by average salary.
3. `Data_Science_Jobs_Distribution_by_Experience_Level.sql` - Analyzes the distribution of Data Science jobs by experience level.
4. `Work_Model_Preferences_in_Data_Science.sql` - Examines the preferences for work models (in-person, remote, hybrid) in Data Science.
5. `Distribution_of_Salaries_in_Data_Science.sql` - Explores the distribution of salaries across different ranges in Data Science.
6. `Yearly_Salary_Trends_in_Data_Science.sql` - Analyzes the yearly trends in salaries, including average and median salary figures.
7. `How_Experience_Influences_Data_Science_Salaries.sql` - Looks into how different levels of experience impact salaries in Data Science over the years.

## How to Use
To use these queries, you will need access to a database containing the `jobs_in_data` table with the appropriate schema. Once you have set up your database:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open your SQL client and connect to your database.
